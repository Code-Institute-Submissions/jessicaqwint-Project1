    <h3>The differences between Mindfulness and Mindset</h3>
    <b>
        Mindfulness is a passive practice that allows us to pause and observe (our habitual thoughts) with curiosity. Mindset is the active practice of identifying depleting thought patterns and replacing them with positive thoughts that are more supportive and compassionate of ourselves. Mindset is curating a library of renewing emotions and thoughts that reduce our stress and create emotional resilience.
